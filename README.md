# dotfiles
My all config files for my Arch Linux setup with Kde Plasma.

Clone the repo to ~/dotfiles and use the install-dotfiles.sh script to install all the dotfiles automatically.

NOTE: Some of the config files may need aditional steps after installing them to the right directories for it to actually work. (eg. rofi and conky)
